# UniFi Provider

The UniFi provider enables infrastructure-as-code management of [Ubiquiti's UniFi](https://www.ui.com/) network controllers and devices. This provider allows you to automate the configuration and management of your UniFi network infrastructure using Terraform.

## Supported Features

- Manage UniFi network resources using Infrastructure as Code
- Support for UniFi Controller version 6.x and later
- Compatible with UDM, UDM-Pro, UCG, and standard controller deployments
- Comprehensive resource management including:
    - Network/WLAN configuration
    - Firewall rules and groups
    - Port forwarding
    - DNS records
    - User management
    - Device management
    - And more...

## Supported Platforms

* UniFi Controller version 6.x and later
* UniFi Dream Machine (UDM)
* UniFi Dream Machine Pro (UDM-Pro)
* UniFi Cloud Gateway (UCG)
* Standard UniFi Controller deployments

## Authentication

The provider supports two authentication methods:

* **Username/Password Authentication** (Traditional method)
* **API Key Authentication** (Recommended, requires controller version 9.0.108 or later)

!> Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system.

### Security Recommendations

* Use API Key authentication instead of username/password
* Create a dedicated service account for Terraform with appropriate permissions
* Use a **Limited Admin** role with **Local Access Only**
* Enable HTTPS and valid SSL certificates for your controller
* Store credentials securely using Terraform variables or environment variables
* Two-factor authentication (2FA) is not supported

### Generating an API Key

1. Open your Site in UniFi Site Manager
2. Click on `Control Plane -> Admins & Users`.
3. Select your Admin user.
4. Click `Create API Key`.
5. Add a name for your API Key.
6. Copy the key and store it securely, as it will only be displayed once.
7. Click `Done` to ensure the key is hashed and securely stored.
8. Use the API Key ðŸŽ‰
