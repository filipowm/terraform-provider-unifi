# unifi_static_route (Resource)

The `unifi_static_route` resource manages static routes on UniFi Security Gateways (USG) and UniFi Dream Machines (UDM/UDM-Pro).

Static routes allow you to manually configure routing paths for specific networks. This is useful for:
  * Connecting to networks not directly connected to your UniFi gateway
  * Creating backup routes for redundancy
  * Implementing policy-based routing
  * Blocking traffic to specific networks using blackhole routes

Routes can be configured to use either a next-hop IP address, a specific interface, or as a blackhole route.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "unifi_static_route" "nexthop" {
  type     = "nexthop-route"
  network  = "172.17.0.0/16"
  name     = "basic nexthop"
  distance = 1
  next_hop = "172.16.0.1"
}

resource "unifi_static_route" "blackhole" {
  type     = "blackhole"
  network  = var.blackhole_cidr
  name     = "blackhole traffice to cidr"
  distance = 1
}

resource "unifi_static_route" "interface" {
  type      = "interface-route"
  network   = var.wan2_cidr
  name      = "send traffic over wan2"
  distance  = 1
  interface = "WAN2"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `distance` (Number) The administrative distance for this route. Lower values are preferred. Use this to control route selection when multiple routes to the same destination exist.
- `name` (String) A friendly name for the static route to help identify its purpose (e.g., 'Backup DC Link' or 'Cloud VPN Route').
- `network` (String) The destination network in CIDR notation that this route will direct traffic to (e.g., '10.0.0.0/16' or '192.168.100.0/24').
- `type` (String) The type of static route. Valid values are:
  * `interface-route` - Route traffic through a specific interface
  * `nexthop-route` - Route traffic to a specific next-hop IP address
  * `blackhole` - Drop all traffic to this network

### Optional

- `interface` (String) The outbound interface to use for this route. Only used when type is set to 'interface-route'. Can be:
  * `WAN1` - Primary WAN interface
  * `WAN2` - Secondary WAN interface
  * A network ID for internal networks
- `next_hop` (String) The IP address of the next hop router for this route. Only used when type is set to 'nexthop-route'. This should be an IP address that is directly reachable from your UniFi gateway.
- `site` (String) The name of the UniFi site where the static route should be created. If not specified, the default site will be used.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the static route in the UniFi controller.
