# unifi_account (Resource)

The `unifi_account` resource manages RADIUS user accounts in the UniFi controller's built-in RADIUS server.

This resource is used for:
  * WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise wireless authentication
  * 802.1X wired authentication
  * MAC-based device authentication
  * VLAN assignment through RADIUS attributes

Important Notes:
1. For MAC-based authentication:
   * Use the device's MAC address as both username and password
   * Convert MAC address to uppercase with no separators (e.g., '00:11:22:33:44:55' becomes '001122334455')
2. VLAN Assignment:
   * If no VLAN is specified in the profile, clients will use the network's untagged VLAN
   * VLAN assignment uses standard RADIUS tunnel attributes

Limitations:
  * MAC-based authentication works only for wireless and wired clients
  * L2TP remote access VPN is not supported with MAC authentication
  * Accounts must be unique within a site

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The username for this RADIUS account. For regular users, this can be any unique identifier. For MAC-based authentication, this must be the device's MAC address in uppercase with no separators (e.g., '001122334455').
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for this RADIUS account. For MAC-based authentication, this must match the username (the MAC address). For regular users, this should be a secure password following your organization's password policies.

### Optional

- `network_id` (String) The ID of the network (VLAN) to assign to clients authenticating with this account. This is used in conjunction with the tunnel attributes to provide VLAN assignment via RADIUS.
- `site` (String) The name of the UniFi site where this RADIUS account should be created. If not specified, the default site will be used.
- `tunnel_medium_type` (Number) The RADIUS tunnel medium type attribute ([RFC 2868](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2868), section 3.2). Common values:
  * `6` - 802 (includes Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI) (default)
  * `1` - IPv4
  * `2` - IPv6

Only change this if you need specific tunneling behavior. Defaults to `6`.
- `tunnel_type` (Number) The RADIUS tunnel type attribute ([RFC 2868](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2868), section 3.1). Common values:
  * `13` - VLAN (default)
  * `1` - Point-to-Point Protocol (PPTP)
  * `9` - Point-to-Point Protocol (L2TP)

Only change this if you need specific tunneling behavior. Defaults to `13`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the RADIUS account in the UniFi controller. This is automatically assigned.
