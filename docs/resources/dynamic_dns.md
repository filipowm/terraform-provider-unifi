# unifi_dynamic_dns (Resource)

The `unifi_dynamic_dns` resource manages Dynamic DNS (DDNS).

Dynamic DNS allows you to access your network using a domain name even when your public IP address changes. This is useful for:
  * Remote access to your network
  * Hosting services from your home/office network
  * VPN connections to your network

The resource supports various DDNS providers including:
  * DynDNS
  * No-IP
  * Duck DNS
  * And many others

Each DDNS configuration can be associated with either the primary (WAN) or secondary (WAN2) interface.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "unifi_dynamic_dns" "test" {
  service = "dyndns"

  host_name = "my-network.example.com"

  server   = "domains.google.com"
  login    = var.dns_login
  password = var.dns_password
}
```
