# unifi_firewall_group (Resource)

The `unifi_firewall_group` resource manages reusable groups of addresses or ports that can be referenced in firewall rules (`unifi_firewall_rule`).

Firewall groups help organize and simplify firewall rule management by allowing you to:
  * Create collections of IP addresses or networks
  * Define sets of ports for specific services
  * Group IPv6 addresses for IPv6-specific rules

Common use cases include:
  * Creating groups of trusted IP addresses
  * Defining port groups for specific applications
  * Managing access control lists
  * Simplifying rule maintenance by using groups instead of individual IPs/ports

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "laptop_ips" {
  type = list(string)
}

resource "unifi_firewall_group" "can_print" {
  name = "can-print"
  type = "address-group"

  members = var.laptop_ips
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `members` (Set of String) List of members in the group. The format depends on the group type:
  * For address-group: IPv4 addresses or CIDR notation (e.g., ['192.168.1.10', '10.0.0.0/8'])
  * For port-group: Port numbers or ranges (e.g., ['80', '443', '8000-8080'])
  * For ipv6-address-group: IPv6 addresses or CIDR notation
- `name` (String) A friendly name for the firewall group to help identify its purpose (e.g., 'Trusted IPs' or 'Web Server Ports'). Must be unique within the site.
- `type` (String) The type of firewall group. Valid values are:
  * `address-group` - Group of IPv4 addresses and/or networks (e.g., '192.168.1.10', '10.0.0.0/8')
  * `port-group` - Group of ports or port ranges (e.g., '80', '443', '8000-8080')
  * `ipv6-address-group` - Group of IPv6 addresses and/or networks

### Optional

- `site` (String) The name of the UniFi site where the firewall group should be created. If not specified, the default site will be used.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the firewall group in the UniFi controller.
