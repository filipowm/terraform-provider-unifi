# unifi_radius_profile (Resource)

The `unifi_radius_profile` resource manages RADIUS authentication profiles for UniFi networks.

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) profiles enable enterprise-grade authentication and authorization for:
  * 802.1X network access control
  * WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise wireless networks
  * Dynamic VLAN assignment
  * User activity accounting

Each profile can be configured with:
  * Multiple authentication and accounting servers
  * VLAN assignment settings
  * Accounting update intervals

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) A friendly name for the RADIUS profile to help identify its purpose (e.g., 'Corporate Users' or 'Guest Access').

### Optional

- `accounting_enabled` (Boolean) Enable RADIUS accounting to track user sessions, including login/logout times and data usage. Useful for billing and audit purposes. Defaults to `false`.
- `acct_server` (Block List) List of RADIUS accounting servers to use with this profile. Accounting servers track session data like connection time and data usage. Each server requires:
  * IP address of the RADIUS server
  * Port number (default: 1813)
  * Shared secret for secure communication (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--acct_server))
- `auth_server` (Block List) List of RADIUS authentication servers to use with this profile. Multiple servers provide failover - if the first server is unreachable, the system will try the next server in the list. Each server requires:
  * IP address of the RADIUS server
  * Shared secret for secure communication (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--auth_server))
- `interim_update_enabled` (Boolean) Enable periodic updates during active sessions. This allows tracking of ongoing session data like bandwidth usage. Defaults to `false`.
- `interim_update_interval` (Number) The interval (in seconds) between interim updates when `interim_update_enabled` is true. Default is 3600 seconds (1 hour). Defaults to `3600`.
- `site` (String) The name of the UniFi site where the RADIUS profile should be created. If not specified, the default site will be used.
- `use_usg_acct_server` (Boolean) Use the controller as a RADIUS accounting server. This allows local accounting without an external RADIUS server. Defaults to `false`.
- `use_usg_auth_server` (Boolean) Use the controller as a RADIUS authentication server. This allows local authentication without an external RADIUS server. Defaults to `false`.
- `vlan_enabled` (Boolean) Enable VLAN assignment for wired clients based on RADIUS attributes. This allows network segmentation based on user authentication. Defaults to `false`.
- `vlan_wlan_mode` (String) VLAN assignment mode for wireless networks. Valid values are:
  * `disabled` - Do not use RADIUS-assigned VLANs
  * `optional` - Use RADIUS-assigned VLAN if provided
  * `required` - Require RADIUS-assigned VLAN for authentication to succeed Defaults to ``.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the RADIUS profile in the UniFi controller.

<a id="nestedblock--acct_server"></a>
### Nested Schema for `acct_server`

Required:

- `ip` (String) The IPv4 address of the RADIUS accounting server (e.g., '192.168.1.100'). Must be reachable from your UniFi network.
- `xsecret` (String, Sensitive) The shared secret key used to secure communication between the UniFi controller and the RADIUS server. This must match the secret configured on your RADIUS server.

Optional:

- `port` (Number) The UDP port number where the RADIUS accounting service is listening. The standard port is 1813, but this can be changed if needed to match your server configuration. Defaults to `1813`.


<a id="nestedblock--auth_server"></a>
### Nested Schema for `auth_server`

Required:

- `ip` (String) The IPv4 address of the RADIUS authentication server (e.g., '192.168.1.100'). Must be reachable from your UniFi network.
- `xsecret` (String, Sensitive) The shared secret key used to secure communication between the UniFi controller and the RADIUS server. This must match the secret configured on your RADIUS server.

Optional:

- `port` (Number) The UDP port number where the RADIUS authentication service is listening. The standard port is 1812, but this can be changed if needed to match your server configuration. Defaults to `1812`.
