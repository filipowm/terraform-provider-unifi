# unifi_port_profile (Resource)

The `unifi_port_profile` resource manages port profiles that can be applied to UniFi switch ports.

Port profiles define a collection of settings that can be applied to one or more switch ports, including:
  * Network and VLAN settings
  * Port speed and duplex settings
  * Security features like 802.1X authentication and port isolation
  * Rate limiting and QoS settings
  * Network protocols like LLDP and STP

Creating port profiles allows for consistent configuration across multiple switch ports and easier management of port settings.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "vlan_id" {
  default = 10
}

resource "unifi_network" "vlan" {
  name    = "wifi-vlan"
  purpose = "corporate"

  subnet       = "10.0.0.1/24"
  vlan_id      = var.vlan_id
  dhcp_start   = "10.0.0.6"
  dhcp_stop    = "10.0.0.254"
  dhcp_enabled = true
}

resource "unifi_port_profile" "poe_disabled" {
  name = "POE Disabled"

  native_networkconf_id = unifi_network.vlan.id
  poe_mode              = "off"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `autoneg` (Boolean) Enable automatic negotiation of port speed and duplex settings. When enabled, this overrides manual speed and duplex settings. Recommended for most use cases. Defaults to `true`.
- `dot1x_ctrl` (String) 802.1X port-based network access control (PNAC) mode. Valid values are:
  * `force_authorized` - Port allows all traffic, no authentication required (default)
  * `force_unauthorized` - Port blocks all traffic regardless of authentication
  * `auto` - Standard 802.1X authentication required before port access is granted
  * `mac_based` - Authentication based on client MAC address, useful for devices that don't support 802.1X
  * `multi_host` - Allows multiple devices after first successful authentication, common in VoIP phone setups

Use 'auto' for highest security, 'mac_based' for legacy devices, and 'multi_host' when daisy-chaining devices. Defaults to `force_authorized`.
- `dot1x_idle_timeout` (Number) The number of seconds before an inactive authenticated MAC address is removed when using MAC-based 802.1X control. Range: 0-65535 seconds. Defaults to `300`.
- `egress_rate_limit_kbps` (Number) The maximum outbound bandwidth allowed on the port in kilobits per second. Range: 64-9999999 kbps. Only applied when egress_rate_limit_kbps_enabled is true.
- `egress_rate_limit_kbps_enabled` (Boolean) Enable outbound bandwidth rate limiting on the port. When enabled, traffic will be limited to the rate specified in egress_rate_limit_kbps. Defaults to `false`.
- `excluded_network_ids` (Set of String) List of network IDs to exclude when forward is set to 'customize'. This allows you to prevent specific networks from being accessible on ports using this profile.
