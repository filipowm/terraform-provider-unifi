# unifi_dns_record (Resource)

The `unifi_dns_record` resource manages DNS records in the UniFi controller's DNS server.

This resource allows you to configure various types of DNS records for local name resolution. Common use cases include:
  * Creating A records for local servers and devices
  * Setting up CNAME aliases for internal services
  * Configuring MX records for local mail servers
  * Adding TXT records for service verification

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "unifi_dns_record" "a_record" {
    name   = "example.mydomain.com"
    type   = "A"
    record = "192.168.1.190"
}

resource "unifi_dns_record" "cname_record" {
    name   = "example.mydomain.com"
    type   = "CNAME"
    record = "example.com"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) DNS record name.
- `record` (String) The content of the DNS record. The expected value depends on the record type:
  * For A records: IPv4 address (e.g., '192.168.1.10')
  * For AAAA records: IPv6 address
  * For CNAME records: Canonical name (e.g., 'server1.example.com')
  * For MX records: Mail server hostname
  * For TXT records: Text content (e.g., 'v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all')
- `type` (String) The type of DNS record. Valid values are:
  * `A` - Maps a hostname to IPv4 address
  * `AAAA` - Maps a hostname to IPv6 address
  * `CNAME` - Creates an alias for another domain name
  * `MX` - Specifies mail servers for the domain
  * `NS` - Delegates a subdomain to a set of name servers
  * `PTR` - Creates a pointer to a canonical name (reverse DNS)
  * `SOA` - Specifies authoritative information about the domain
  * `SRV` - Specifies location of services (hostname and port)
  * `TXT` - Holds descriptive text

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the DNS record is active. Defaults to true. Set to false to temporarily disable resolution without removing the record.
- `port` (Number) The port number for SRV records. Valid values are between 1 and 65535. Only used with SRV records.
- `priority` (Number) Priority value for MX and SRV records. Lower values indicate higher priority. Required for MX and SRV records, ignored for other types.
- `site` (String) The name of the UniFi site where this resource should be applied. If not specified, the default site will be used.
- `ttl` (Number) Time To Live (TTL) in seconds, determines how long DNS resolvers should cache this record. Set to 0 for automatic TTL. Common values: 300 (5 minutes), 3600 (1 hour), 86400 (1 day).
- `weight` (Number) A relative weight for SRV records with the same priority. Higher values get proportionally more traffic. Only used with SRV records.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of this resource.
