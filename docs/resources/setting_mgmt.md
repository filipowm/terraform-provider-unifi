# unifi_setting_mgmt (Resource)

The `unifi_setting_mgmt` resource manages site-wide management settings in the UniFi controller.

This resource allows you to configure important management features including:
  * Automatic firmware upgrades for UniFi devices
  * SSH access for advanced configuration and troubleshooting
  * SSH key management for secure remote access

These settings affect how the UniFi controller manages devices at the site level. They are particularly important for:
  * Maintaining device security through automatic updates
  * Enabling secure remote administration
  * Implementing SSH key-based authentication

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "unifi_site" "example" {
  description = "example"
}

resource "unifi_setting_mgmt" "example" {
  # Reference a specific site (optional, defaults to site configured in provider, otherwise "default")
  site = unifi_site.example.name
  
  # Auto upgrade settings
  auto_upgrade = true
  auto_upgrade_hour = 3
  
  # Device management settings
  advanced_feature_enabled = true
  alert_enabled = true
  boot_sound = false
  debug_tools_enabled = true
  direct_connect_enabled = false
  led_enabled = true
  outdoor_mode_enabled = false
  unifi_idp_enabled = false
  wifiman_enabled = true
  
  # SSH access configuration
  ssh_enabled = true
  ssh_auth_password_enabled = true
  ssh_bind_wildcard = false
  ssh_username = "admin"
  
  # Optional: SSH key configuration
  ssh_key = [
    {
      name = "Admin Key"
      type = "ssh-rsa"
      key = "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCxxx..."
      comment = "admin@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `advanced_feature_enabled` (Boolean) Enable advanced features for UniFi devices at this site.
- `alert_enabled` (Boolean) Enable alerts for UniFi devices at this site.
- `auto_upgrade` (Boolean) Enable automatic firmware upgrades for all UniFi devices at this site. When enabled, devices will automatically update to the latest stable firmware version approved for your controller version.
- `auto_upgrade_hour` (Number) The hour of the day (0-23) when automatic firmware upgrades will occur.
- `boot_sound` (Boolean) Enable the boot sound for UniFi devices at this site.
- `debug_tools_enabled` (Boolean) Enable debug tools for UniFi devices at this site. Requires controller version 7.3 or later.
- `direct_connect_enabled` (Boolean) Enable direct connect for UniFi devices at this site.
- `led_enabled` (Boolean) Enable the LED light for UniFi devices at this site.
- `outdoor_mode_enabled` (Boolean) Enable outdoor mode for UniFi devices at this site.
- `site` (String) The name of the UniFi site where this resource should be applied. If not specified, the default site will be used.
- `ssh_auth_password_enabled` (Boolean) Enable SSH password authentication for UniFi devices at this site.
- `ssh_bind_wildcard` (Boolean) Enable SSH bind wildcard for UniFi devices at this site.
- `ssh_enabled` (Boolean) Enable SSH access to UniFi devices at this site. When enabled, you can connect to devices using SSH for advanced configuration and troubleshooting. It's recommended to only enable this temporarily when needed.
- `ssh_key` (Block List) List of SSH public keys that are allowed to connect to UniFi devices when SSH is enabled. Using SSH keys is more secure than password authentication. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--ssh_key))
- `ssh_password` (String, Sensitive) The SSH password for UniFi devices at this site.
- `ssh_username` (String) The SSH username for UniFi devices at this site.
- `unifi_idp_enabled` (Boolean) Enable UniFi IDP for UniFi devices at this site.
- `wifiman_enabled` (Boolean) Enable WiFiman for UniFi devices at this site.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--ssh_key"></a>
### Nested Schema for `ssh_key`

Required:

- `name` (String) A friendly name for the SSH key to help identify its owner or purpose (e.g., 'admin-laptop' or 'backup-server').
- `type` (String) The type of SSH key. Common values include:
  * `ssh-rsa` - RSA key (most common)
  * `ssh-ed25519` - Ed25519 key (more secure)
  * `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` - ECDSA key

Optional:

- `comment` (String) An optional comment to provide additional context about the key (e.g., 'generated on 2024-01-01' or 'expires 2025-12-31').
- `key` (String) The public key string. This is the content that would normally go in an authorized_keys file, excluding the type and comment (e.g., 'AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA...').
