# unifi_port_forward (Resource)

The `unifi_port_forward` resource manages port forwarding rules on UniFi controllers.

Port forwarding allows external traffic to reach services hosted on your internal network by mapping external ports to internal IP addresses and ports. This is commonly used for:
  * Hosting web servers, game servers, or other services
  * Remote access to internal services
  * Application-specific requirements

Each rule can be configured with source IP restrictions, protocol selection, and logging options for enhanced security and monitoring.

## Schema

### Optional

- `dst_port` (String) The external port(s) that will be forwarded. Can be a single port (e.g., '80') or a port range (e.g., '8080:8090').
- `enabled` (Boolean, Deprecated) Specifies whether the port forwarding rule is enabled or not. Defaults to `true`. This will attribute will be removed in a future release. Instead of disabling a port forwarding rule you can remove it from your configuration.
- `fwd_ip` (String) The internal IPv4 address of the device or service that will receive the forwarded traffic (e.g., '192.168.1.100').
- `fwd_port` (String) The internal port(s) that will receive the forwarded traffic. Can be a single port (e.g., '8080') or a port range (e.g., '8080:8090').
- `log` (Boolean) Enable logging of traffic matching this port forwarding rule. Useful for monitoring and troubleshooting. Defaults to `false`.
- `name` (String) A friendly name for the port forwarding rule to help identify its purpose (e.g., 'Web Server' or 'Game Server').
- `port_forward_interface` (String) The WAN interface to apply the port forwarding rule to. Valid values are:
  * `wan` - Primary WAN interface
  * `wan2` - Secondary WAN interface
  * `both` - Both WAN interfaces
- `protocol` (String) The network protocol(s) this rule applies to. Valid values are:
  * `tcp_udp` - Both TCP and UDP (default)
  * `tcp` - TCP only
  * `udp` - UDP only Defaults to `tcp_udp`.
- `site` (String) The name of the UniFi site where the port forwarding rule should be created. If not specified, the default site will be used.
- `src_ip` (String) The source IP address or network in CIDR notation that is allowed to use this port forward. Use 'any' to allow all source IPs. Examples: '203.0.113.1' for a single IP, '203.0.113.0/24' for a network, or 'any' for all IPs. Defaults to `any`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the port forwarding rule in the UniFi controller.
