# unifi_setting_usg (Resource)

The `unifi_setting_usg` resource manages advanced settings for UniFi Security Gateways (USG) and UniFi Dream Machines (UDM/UDM-Pro).

This resource allows you to configure gateway-specific features including:
  * Multicast DNS (mDNS) for service discovery
  * DHCP relay for forwarding DHCP requests to external servers

These settings are particularly useful for:
  * Enabling device discovery across VLANs (using mDNS)
  * Centralizing DHCP management in enterprise environments
  * Integration with existing network infrastructure

Note: Some settings may not be available on all controller versions. For example, multicast_dns_enabled is not supported on UniFi OS v7+.

## Schema

### Optional

- `dhcp_relay_servers` (List of String) List of up to 5 DHCP relay servers (specified by IP address) that will receive forwarded DHCP requests. This is useful when you want to use external DHCP servers instead of the built-in DHCP server. Example: ['192.168.1.5', '192.168.2.5']
- `multicast_dns_enabled` (Boolean) Enable multicast DNS (mDNS/Bonjour/Avahi) forwarding across VLANs. This allows devices to discover services (like printers, Chromecasts, etc.) even when they are on different networks. Note: Not supported on UniFi OS v7+.
- `site` (String) The name of the UniFi site where these USG settings should be applied. If not specified, the default site will be used.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the USG settings configuration in the UniFi controller.
