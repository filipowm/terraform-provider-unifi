# unifi_site (Resource)

The `unifi_site` resource manages UniFi sites, which are logical groupings of UniFi devices and their configurations.

Sites in UniFi are used to:
  * Organize network devices and settings for different physical locations
  * Isolate configurations between different networks or customers
  * Apply different policies and configurations to different groups of devices

Each site maintains its own:
  * Network configurations
  * Wireless networks (WLANs)
  * Security policies
  * Device configurations

A UniFi controller can manage multiple sites, making it ideal for multi-tenant or distributed network deployments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "unifi_site" "mysite" {
  description = "mysite"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) A human-readable description of the site (e.g., 'Main Office', 'Remote Branch', 'Client A Network'). This is used as the display name in the UniFi controller interface.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the site in the UniFi controller. This is automatically generated when the site is created.
- `name` (String) The site's internal name in the UniFi system. This is automatically generated based on the description and is used in API calls and configurations. It's typically a lowercase, hyphenated version of the description.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# import using the API/UI ID
terraform import unifi_site.mysite 5fe6261995fe130013456a36

# import using the name (short ID)
terraform import unifi_site.mysite vq98kwez
```
